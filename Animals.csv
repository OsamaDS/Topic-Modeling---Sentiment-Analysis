It was altogether a different experience. However I feel it could have been made better if she had used a professional camera. In my humble opinion,this is one of the experiences which is best enjoyed in real life than in virtual.To enhance this virtual experience though, I strongly feel that she needs a professional camera and a video stabilizer(if you like,I can suggest you some cameras or apps which might help ). As for a virtual/online experience video covers literally more than half the experience, so its essential to get that right. The video was quite blurry most of the times and pixelated in general which was kind of a bummer.Network connectivity is another thing which can be looked into, but I guess being a wildlife Safari it's understandable that the network might fluctuate.

Our family and friends joined virtually from across the country and Noeline provided the BEST birthday experience. We loved seeing her farm and her smiling animals (seriously, they smile for the camera!) but the real fun started when we learned how to draw Cadbury the llama. Noeline is a talented illustrator and animator and she broke down the drawing process into easy steps that led all of us non-illustrators to have fun, silly and successful drawings! Our group was all adults (with one 3 year-old) and we just had a blast. I also think this would be magical for families with children.  Noeline and Cadbury are an absolute delight and I am so thankful we were able to give my mom such a special quarantine birthday! I highly recommend this unique, fun and creative experience.

You can even learn a bit about the history of sheep farming  in New Zealand.Next, I'll explain how wool is shorn from the sheep, skirted, washed & dried.

We might meet Joey the sheep dog too.I'll use the wool that we've just made to give you a spinning demo on my spinning wheel. There will be lots of opportunity for guests to ask questions about farming, our friendly, wooly friends or wool processing.This Experience is great fun for corporate events, team-building, date nights, and special occasions with friends and family. You're welcome to book a private experience for your group for lots of laughs, time to connect with nature and de-stress and learn a bit along the way.

This was such a supercool way to learn, and who doesn't want to see the New Zealand countryside? Angie introduced us to her sheep (or, rather, they introduced themselves to us! nobody was camera shy!), and she explained many unique aspects of woolmaking. I was especially fascinated by the historical aspects and seeing all the working parts of the farm, including  watching Angie use the spinning wheel. Angie had my husband and I play a quiz game that really brought out our personalities and a lot of laughs. And I loved her personal story about moving to NZ and the difference that wearing wool clothing made. I'd really recommend this experience.

The session was informative and helped me appreciate sharks from a new perspective. This may not be the most suitable event if you are looking to do team bonding. While there are designed participant-host interactions, there are limited opportunities to get to know your teammates through the experience. The host prioritized getting through her presentation over answering questions that the participants had. For that reason, I personally find the price of the experience high.

Regarding the questions, with big groups it is not always possible to take questions at any time during the presentation without running over time so the Q&A sessions, of which there are 4, provide a structure to accommodate all participants’ questions. I enjoyed answering the many questions your team had during these sessions with time to spare during the last one. Should a guest wish to ask a question outside of the Q&A, and while the host is still speaking, guests normally raise their hand, which allows one to acknowledge them and answer it as soon as one can. Another option is to use the Chat function if the host is still speaking. I hope this helps explain and I apologize if I did not make this clear at the start.'}}, {'time': 'October 2020', 'name': 'Antje', 'comment': 'Herzlichen Dank für deinen engagierten Vortrag - du hast mir mit deiner offenen und inspirierenden Art die Angst vor Haien genommen .

Even though I booked the experience 10 minutes before the start-time, it went smoothly as I immediately received a zoom link upon booking. I'm glad I picked the seal recue as my first experience! As everyone else during Covid, I miss traveling so much and this made me feel like I had a little lunch get-away to Ireland. :) (I am in Miami, FL). Krysten was a great host and she began by going over some facts about seals that the rescue encounters. The presentation was followed by Krysten giving us a live tour of the rescue facility; from the feed room to the ICU, to the pools where the seals that are getting closer to release are kept. Krysten described the different conditions that the rescued sealed had when they arrived at the facility and how they had been rehabilitated. I loved that the tour was live, nor prerecorded, so you could ask questions in real time.I highly recommend this experience, not only is it fun and interesting (and great for kids!) but you will also support the seal rescue (and the heaps and heaps of fish that their little patients consume!)

Time flies quickly, guided by an excellent hand and friendly, patient smiles.

Would love to visit in person and return.**It is pretty well known that while there are many exceptional hosts on the platform like Meagan who are very customer-first, AirBnB’s customer service is less than great. For those in a different time zone, I just recommend confirming with Meagan what time you are meeting as she’s highly responsive. AirBnB had given us a completely different time when we booked (told us to show up an hour early), which meant we had to reschedule with Meagan.

Aside from all this fun we also learned the mission of this sanctuary and ways we can participate in the mission. Lots of families joined during our session and it was enjoyable for all ages.

Almost every cat owner with a behavior problem asks the question ""How do I stop this behavior from happening?"" But to stop a behavior we have to know why the cat is doing it in the first place.First we  look at basic categories of behavior because each category needs a different response from us. You will  start to see how your cat fits into these ideas, and start to make connections, like ""Eeeeek, I've taught my cat to beg for food!"" or ""Yikes, my cat has turned me into a giant mouse and is hunting me!""Then we discuss three underlying evolutionary and adaptive forces that drive much of cat behavior. If our cat isn't getting its needs met with respect to how these forces push them, problems will occur.While primarily an educational experience, it is also a passionate, and interactive look at cat behavior with video, and photos, and allows Q&A throughout and ends with an extensive Q&A where each guest gets to ask behavior questions about their cat!","I've been working with cats professionally since 2002 much of that time with a nationally known animal welfare org. Currently I work with one of the largest  open admission shelters in the USA as a feline behavior specialist. I've done many hundreds of behavior consultations on Airbnb, as well as via my website https://cat-behavior-help.com on Zoom and in person at the animal shelters where I have worked and I have given webinars on cat behavior to public libraries and shelters all over the USA and internationally in the UK, Singapore, Germany and China.I also have another cat behavior experience, see https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1725425 and read over 125, 5 star only reviews!",Host on Airbnb since 2013,"Meet your Host, Stephen",https://z1.muscache.cn/im/pictures/user/5ee519e1-f99c-4929-b9f9-6135d1349c01.jpg?im_w=240,"[{'time': 'October 2021', 'name': 'Enjoli', 'comment': 'This was such a fun class with lots of participations and questions.

Then we will have a close look of their paws to learn the pseudo-thumb.Through show and tell, I will introduce a brown panda and a gray panda.(little gray) She's still in the park.

He shares a great deal about the individual pandas, their family history, their characteristics as a species, how and where they are or have been in the world's zoos as well as just a genuine love for pandas that is evident in his tours.  Something I really like about the tour is that, for those of us who cannot be there in person, the tour feels like you are really there.  You join him as he walks towards each panda and he shows you their sign, their name and gives you a little bit of their background story from his own experience.  Then he shows you the habitat and we try to locate the panda.  Sometimes you have to look for them, just like you would if you were visiting the zoo yourself.  He is an awesome tour guide and tells you about the city the panda base is located in, interesting facts about their habitat within the base and sometimes even chats with keepers or visitors who have insight into the pandas.  I hope other people who would like to learn about pandas will try the tours and set aside an hour to follow along and enjoy the panda tour."", 'reply': {'time': 'June 2021', 'name': 'Response from Alvin', 'comment': ""Thank you Anna for your kind feedback.

I love sharing what I know about bees and beekeeping with others in a way that is fun and accessible.Find more on IG @ascolmeiasdajoana",Host on Airbnb since 2015,"Meet your Host, Joana",https://z1.muscache.cn/im/users/25973593/profile_pic/1434945517/original.jpg?im_w=240,"[{'time': 'March 2022', 'name': 'Megan', 'comment': 'Fantastic experience!

As a result, when she pulled out frames frames from one of her numerous hives I was able to spot a queen bee!  She rescues bees and she raises them organically. Bonus: she taught us a bit about growing cork as she made a brief walk though the hillside and tree canopy to her apiary.  I'm a huge fan of this experience and highly recommend it. I learned many new facts about bees. I'll now look to add bee pollen to my diet.
