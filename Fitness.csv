This is an experience about Warmth and Self-healing. Who doesn’t want WARMTH? :)How is the temperature of your hands and feet? Are they quite warm, just lukewarm, or cold? If you want an interesting work/family event, feel your own hands and feet first, shake hands with people, feel the temperatures of your people’s hands. Then listen to me. Let me share my experience. It is MAGIC. I do this Chinese wellness practice a few times each week. What can I feel? My fingers, toes, hands and feet are always warm, not just lukewarm, it is very warm in a healthy way. Not only hands and feet, my whole body is also quite warm in a healthy way. This exercise increases my microcirculation, which is evidenced by the warmth from my fingers down to my toes. Good for all agesWeekend special price for individuals.","The temperatures of our hands and feet are good signs of circulations and microcirculations. It is a magic exercise, and it takes time and regular practice to reach the best result, all-day-long WARMTH. You could feel it more or less after the first experience.
