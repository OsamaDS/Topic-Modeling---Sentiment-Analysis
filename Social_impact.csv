I enjoyed answering the many questions your team had during these sessions with time to spare during the last one. Should a guest wish to ask a question outside of the Q&A, and while the host is still speaking, guests normally raise their hand, which allows one to acknowledge them and answer it as soon as one can.

As everyone else during Covid, I miss traveling so much and this made me feel like I had a little lunch get-away to Ireland. :) (I am in Miami, FL). Krysten was a great host and she began by going over some facts about seals that the rescue encounters. The presentation was followed by Krysten giving us a live tour of the rescue facility; from the feed room to the ICU, to the pools where the seals that are getting closer to release are kept. Krysten described the different conditions that the rescued sealed had when they arrived at the facility and how they had been rehabilitated. I loved that the tour was live, nor prerecorded, so you could ask questions in real time.I highly recommend this experience, not only is it fun and interesting (and great for kids!) but you will also support the seal rescue (and the heaps and heaps of fish that their little patients consume!)

During the class, she walked us through each step carefully, making sure everyone was on the same page, and shared stories with us about her mother and cooking experience.

Even if we had others, I know it would have been just as wonderful (I've done a couple of these cooking experiences now and it's fun private && with strangers). She introduced her husband and her cat who popped in and out - it was lovely. The setup was so easy to see - she clearly is a pro at this. She was incredibly patient, kind, friendly, funny and knew how to course correct when of course we turned on our burner too high and slightly charred our meatballs or our pan was a bit too big and our egg started to get crumbly (tasty regardless of our mistakes!). And just as she said would happen in a joking manner, I couldn't wait until the end to start eating - the food was so simple to put together and so incredibly tasty, and I have a very sensitive GI. And honestly, creating a little bento was just so fun - to see something so cute at the end of cooking! I need to figure out how to make those cute characters now! Thanks for a truly wonderful time.

She will help you produce beautiful, healthy results even if you don't have an official bento box (me). 🙂 I had fun learning how to make teriyaki sauce from scratch, meatballs, and a small egg omelet. Putting it all together with the fruits, vegetables, and rice you already have is fun! I highly recommend Yasuyo's online experience.  Many thanks! 🙏"", 'reply': {'time': 'September 2020', 'name': 'Response from Yasuyo', 'comment': 'Thank you so much for taking my cooking class!!
