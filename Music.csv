The opportunity to interact with them was a treat and their performances were beautifully designed and delivered. My only recommendation is not for our hosts but rather for their guests: the sound will be much improved by the use of headphones. This wasn't possible for us given that we were using one computer and didn't have wireless headphones that could share the same signal. Headphones would have enhanced the experience; especially, I'm sure, the last piece, which invited guests to hum along. The resonance from doing this profoundly connects the listener to Dorette's cello music and Suzuki's chanting.

While the description had mentioned the use of both Spanish and English, I didn't expect that 90% of the explanation would be in Spanish. If that were to be the case, I think the host should say that the event is in Spanish, with a smattering of English thrown in. The actual music made up only about 20 or 30 minutes of the whole 75 minute experience (excluding the Q&A which went on for a good 20 minutes extra, none of which was in English). Given that almost all of the history and theory were in Spanish, I'd be lying if I said I gained much from the experience. The host spoke at length in Spanish and would stop to only translate one sentence here and there. While everyone else received detailed explanations of the different styles of flamenco, I was only told the names and maybe a sentence about the origin. If the host is unable to cram in explanations in two languages, then they could simply have different time slots for different languages. Almost all of the other people at the experience likely spoke more English that I did Spanish (read nil). In which case, the host could have simply used English or atleast genuinely made an attempt to translate in both languages. Not simply pick-and-choose sentences to translate while showing a slideshow and speaking in Spanish 90% of the time. My partner who speaks Spanish enjoyed the experience. I'm sure if I could have comprehended even half of it, I would be leaving a more positive review. However, I paid as much as everyone else at the experience, so I don't see why I was shortchanged. It was a thoroughly exclusionary experience, and one I would be loathe to go through again. I don't know why I need to pay to be made to feel like an outsider or someone to whom a translation is an obligation and not simply, the fulfillment of a service that was paid for.The music itself was enjoyable.

So this review is from me, not from her. I'm the one who is into flamenco.For starters, I came to this experience with high expectations. I was not disappointed. Santiago's passion for flamenco was infectious. And his broad historical and cultural perspective on the subject was very enlightening. Where I had believed that flamenco was essentially a gypsy phenomenon, he was able to convey in words and in the music itself how flamenco has incorporated the musical roots of many different cultures. I especially appreciated how he captured the overlap of Moorish chanting with the sounds of flamenco singing and guitar playing. It is technologically challenging to transmit the brilliant staccatos of the flamenco guitar over the internet. But in spite of this limitation, Santiago was able to convey how the various flamenco styles have evolved in various regions of Spain and in various historical eras to yield the incredible diversity and complexity of rhythms in this genre. With no hesitation whatsoever, I would encourage  anyone with an interest in or appreciation of flamenco to take advantage of Santiago's availability to share his vast knowledge of and expertise in this deeply passionate musical expression. And be sure to ask Santiago any questions you may have. He packs a lot into his presentation. But he's ready to fly with your curiosity to areas that he hadn't already scripted.

They each have lovely voices and wonderful hosting skills, giving little anecdotes, some cool music knowledge and info about themselves in between songs. It was low pressure in terms of talking and the interactions felt natural - asking those who were comfortable to share their familiarity with jazz and even allowing us to request songs or ask questions on video or in the chat, which Theo operated quite deftly considering he was also playing the piano, singing and hosting. For the best experience I would suggest having your cameras on and nice little cocktail - taking the opportunity to chat and interact or just sitting back and giving a cheers, smile or a muted clap so they feel the love. We had had a small group, but booked 10 of these experiences for our company‚Äôs employees to sign up for.

She compelled a bit of light conversation from each of us making us feel at ease and welcomed to the experience. Started out with an introduction on the moods, feelings, or thoughts we might get out of each piece she played in which became my focus and I really experienced the musical journey in my own personal way. Meditation is most certainly not my strong suit- I am constantly moving either mentally or physically I'm afraid, so I wrote while she played. Gathering my thoughts on paper. The first song I felt as though I had started a journey & I was searching for answers to my questions on things in my life. Also it seemed as though I was traveling to different parts of the world- thus my desire to be free and experience the beauty of the world. Then I felt partly through the end of the song that I was going through a dire situation and felt kind of helpless, depressed, and sort of angry but then soon I was drawn away to another place still seeking, searching some how for something I can't express. The second song also felt like I was drifting, yet more focus, more forbidding, contemplating what step I needed to take in that next moment. Then the third song brought forth a light heartedness; it sounded like a light rain falling on a metal roof; bouncing off almost playfully. Then it became a dance, and it was peaceful, calming, & tranquil. The last song I felt like I was traveling again on my journey through time. I felt like I was walking in a vast open space, but at the same time I was looking through rooms that held old and wonderful memories of my family being together when my grandfather was alive and it seemed to bring back such a wholeness, a way of life that I had depended on, family unity, & the support that one's family gives when it seems all is lost, or on shaky ground. The song ended sweetly and gently leaving me at peace & ready to meet the day with good choices to make, & a steady peace of mind.

Though barely known abroad, Cantautori are the peak of Italian pop music. With them, songs cease to be just entertainment and become a form of civil commitment, introspection, philosophy, art. As a singer-songwriter myself, I followed Cantautori's steps in writing my own songs.I tailored my experience as a tour through 8 Italian cities/artists/songs. Each will be introduced by insightful storytelling and followed by one of my original songs, inspired by each artist. Before performing each song I will give you insights about Cantautori‚Äôs approach to songwriting and how it affected my own style.So, besides traveling through Italy, you'll meet a Cantautore yourself! I will be there to answer your questions.You'll be sent a booklet with all the lyrics of my songs with side English translation; it will also contain notes about Cantautori and their cities. It will be also a keepsake of your experience and possibly the itinerary of your next travel to Italy!I've been doing this experience for a while and discovered it's great for entertaining groups and for team building!","My name is Fabio D'Andrea and I'm a professional musician and singer/songwriter. I've been performing live as a multi-instrumentalist since the late '90s all over Italy. In 2008, my wife Silvia and I founded the first Italian tailored-songs' website. Through CANZONIsuMISURA¬Æ we've written and produced thousands of unique songs for people who want to exchange music as a gift for special occasions. Still, we feel there's nothing more exciting than performing live and connecting with the audience. Since 2013, Silvia and I are also proud Airbnb Superhosts of a guesthouse in Tuscany. Then, as Experiences became a thing, my passion for live music and storytelling led to open our terrace to music enthusiasts from all over the world for 5-stars intimate concerts.Ref: https://www.airbnb.it/experiences/758535",Host on Airbnb since 2012,"Meet your Host, Silvia E Fabio",https://z1.muscache.cn/im/users/2363123/profile_pic/1368486207/original.jpg?im_w=240,"[{'time': 'November 2021', 'name': 'Tony', 'comment': 'We had such a great time with Fabio!

A ride that will leave you smiling and feeling the love? Try hanging out with these two utterly charming people. I get it. They're performers. But they're so much more. They just go together perfectly. Frankly, I'd love just to hang out with them for a day or two. Listen to some music, drink a glass of Malbec, talk about music and about life, make some music together, and maybe even join in the dance. The theme is tango. But who knew that tango comes in so many colorful shades? Their specialty is in the blue spectrum. Kevin's bluesy harmonica blends with Maria's subtle guitar and (to my ears) her French-toned voice in a truly beguiling way. In delicious instrumental counterpoint, he whispers back to her the fiery passion of her words, quietly echoing their shared longings for a perfect synchrony of complementarities. And they do it as smoothly as a polished pair of tango dancers. This is uniquely creative stuff, and like a great aperitif, it stimulates an appetite for conviviality. Of course, they also took us all out for a ride through the history of tango and the neighborhoods of Buenos Aires where it all began, peaked, faded, and arose again in revitalized forms.

But Cecelo added a down home context that makes it clear just where Bossa Nova fits into the Brazilian cultural scene. Do you know what Bossa means? I didn't. Do you know what it means to walk or work or play Brazilian style? Cecelo's words will put the gentle movement of Boss Nova into your body. It's a quiet thing, subtle, intimate. Talk to him. Ask him questions. Share your own feelings about the music. His enthusiasm is infectious (in a good way). Now if only I could just jet down to Rio and hang out with him on the beach at Ipanema. He makes learning to play Boss Nova on the guitar look fun and easy. And he even makes it clear that anybody can sing in this style.

I had such high hopes, but I was doing my best not to over-expect (so as not to be disappointed). I need not have worried.  The experience met--and very much surpassed--my highest expectations.  The previous reviews did not lead me astray.  Anne worked with my daughter and I to write a song about a recent road trip we had taken down the Mississippi River.   We provided the stories, she the music and structure, and also helped us pare down our stories and put them into a song that at the end perfectly captured our adventure and how we felt about it.  So now, in addition to a memorable road trip, we have an incredible keepsake from that road trip--and the creation of that keepsake in itself is another fantastic memory.  Anne recorded herself singing our song and emailed it to us afterwards, which of course is also amazing. She also shared her background and story, and did a great job breaking down the music writing process--I learned a lot I didn't know about it!  Although I'm glad that before our session my daughter and I brainstormed about something we thought we might want to write a song about, my hunch is that given what a great teacher and musician Anne is, even if you came without an idea, you would land on one pretty quickly with her help.

We get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of dailying life that this was really good for us to just take time to pause and be still away from social media, tv, work etc. The only thing is there was a slight echo at times but most of the time Johnson was playing his instruments so it wasn't too bad. For any future participants I would recommend setting up a comforting atmosphere beforehand. We were running errands and weren't able to carry out our usual self care regimen. But this is the perfect time to lit a few scented candles or take a nice warm bath prior to the event. Doing that would have helped me be able to be in the moment and relax quicker. 10 out of 10 would do this again."", 'reply': {}}, {'time': 'May 2021', 'name': 'Zera', 'comment': 'Meditation with Johnson was thoroughly refreshing.

Since then, I‚Äôve been on a journey to find ‚Äúminashi‚Äù inside myself and perceive own physical existence.

Caitlin is a masterful musician, creator, and host.  Caitlin is warm and kind and makes you feel at ease.  She carefully guides you through the experience while asking insightful questions to better understand the story you want to tell and the song you want to create.  Caitlin is a great listener and created a safe space to be open and vulnerable which translates directly into the lyrics and music produced.  It is truly awe-inspiring to watch a master of their craft work, and in this experience you are right in the action alongside a pro.  Working with Caitlin to develop the structure of the song and lyrics is empowering and easy thanks to her sharply honed songwriting skills and clear understanding of theory. It's a concert in it's own right to watch Caitlin record instrumental and vocal tracks, and just amazing to see her literally sing your song into existence. Caitlin's talent for melody creation, ear for detail, and immense talent are abundantly clear throughout this experience.  To watch her build up vocal harmonies then feel them tug at your soul as they're played back is a powerful thing.  I highly recommend this experience for anyone, especially if you're looking for something that is powerful, creative, a ton of fun.

I was pretty forgiving of this because things happen. Afterwards Beate sent me a note apologizing for the audio issues and offered a full refund and another chance to hear her play at no cost and no audio issues. I didn\'t want the money back; I believe in supporting people as best as you can, especially in times like this. So I responded that no refund was necessary but that I would take her up on going through the experience again at no cost. She didn\'t respond. I circled back, one more time and again, no response whatsoever. So my review is not good because of how she handled it. We paid over $500, so I do believe allowing us to experience the event again without the audio issues was reasonable.
