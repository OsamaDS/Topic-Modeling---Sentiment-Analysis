My wife and I have a bit of experience doing other types of dancing, and the instruction for the basic ""box"" step was agonizingly basic and slow for us.

The host captured our interest from the very beginning by using our names and humor. I chose this event to celebrate my 65th birthday. We had ages from 5 to 74. We all enjoyed it. While the explanations and history might have gone over the children's heads, the pace was quick enough and visually captivating so the children age 7 and up stayed engaged. The music participation was great fun. An impressive touch that no other online experience has done was to send photos that were taken during the session. I think there were 4 people involved in presenting the 1 hour event. The ease with which they coordinated their efforts probably reflects the sophisticated work they apply to their school participation in Carnival. Knowing that the money for this behind the scenes activity is going to support their school, social project and cultural art is heart warming.

Check out my reviews! Great for corporate teams, families, solo travelers & parties!If you can’t find the date or time you want,  don't hesitate to write me! We will open our class with a quick meditation, as an offer and respect for the Balinese culture. After, I will give you a 15 mn introduction about Bali's dances and how the dance is deeply woven within its culture. I will talk about how spirituality influences the day by day of the island and its art, how dance is introduced at a very young age to kids. Then, I will dance for you a small part from the “Condong” dance and we will study together, for 40 mn, few Balinese dance techniques, such as the asymmetrical movements from the hips, legs, torso, feet, arms, hands (mudras) and eyes, and how the dance provides our body with a special energy, connecting the dancer with the material and spiritual world. You will be able to ask me any questions you might have.This is a great way to exercise, to work on your spirituality and relax your mind and body in a different, creative, energetic, empowering & entertaining way. The Balinese culture is very interesting and enjoyable!I also host another Bali experience, where we travel to different places in the island, through beautiful videos.

Are you seeking to deepen your body-awareness? Are you wanting to increase your energy and burn calories but dread the idea of exercise which feels chore-like? As a professional dancer, movement has kept me fit while providing me with joy and meaning. Most sessions are privates for individuals, pairs or groups in the same space or at a distance. While each participant will be exploring their own body and choice-making, the social aspect provides added value and enjoyment. We’ll warm up the body through a guided and flowing improvisation. I’ll explain the difference between prescriptive movement versus descriptive movement and offer tools for exploring new ways of perceiving space, time and energy to enliven your dancing.

This class can be adapted for any age and ability, a family gathering or corporate engagement. Get out of your head and into your body.

During this special edition, before conditioning for our class, I'll go through some Samba rhythms and movements.  I will show you how this connects to the Capoeira roots. As dance conditioning, we will exercise our motor coordination with basic and relaxed movements. I will show you the basic steps in capoeira and we will work on a simple sequence together. We will take a break to give you a tour through the instruments and  to show you how to play capoeira rhythms. Putting all of this together we will practice the blend of dance and fight that is called “jogo de capoeira”. Expect a moderate to intense workout as we adapt the movements to your body.Great for a group dance/workout session! I can also adapt the class for children. Contact me if you would like to book for dates not on the calendar.Other things to noteThe only preparation you need to enjoy this experience is to set up a space in your living room or bedroom. It needs to be large enough to stand with your arms wide out and turn in a circle. A shaded outdoors spot also works well. Set up your camera so that I can see you to fix your movements.","Hello! I am Marcelo, known in the Capoeira world as Professor Marcelo Medusa. I am from Rio de Janeiro, a city with strong Brazilian culture. Rio is one of the centers of Capoeira, an art which blends together dance, music and martial arts. Capoeira was developed by the West Africans that were enslaved in Brazil as disguised combat training, mixing West African, Indigenous and Portuguese cultures. In capoeira, we play music based on percussion instruments like the berimbau, atabaque and pandeiro while two capoeiristas “play” in combat.I have worked with capoeira for 30 years. I have students local to Rio as well as students from other cities and countries. I started an online training practice two years ago via WhatsApp, Facebook and Zoom.  I want to use my experience to help people move in a fun, dynamic and safe practice.",Host on Airbnb since 2020,"Meet your Host, Marcelo",https://z1.muscache.cn/im/pictures/user/d5dde427-3f6a-4d66-a03f-1c7129a45d22.jpg?im_w=240,"[{'time': 'September 2021', 'name': 'Kathryn', 'comment': 'Marcelo is an amazing host and was so great to guide us beginners through the steps slowly before we put everything together.

Then, its times to get started. Marcelo introduces you to some easy moves to build up your confidence. Each sequence builds on the previous sequence. Initially, it can take a little time to get all the moves in the right sequence. I'm sure my efforts were fairly unimpressive though Marcelo really does make you feel at ease and kept encouraging me nonetheless. It's a great workout and certainly you will need water at hand to rehydrate. Also, it's a good idea to wear shorts and t-shirt to allow ease of movement.
