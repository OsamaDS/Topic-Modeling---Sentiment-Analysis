I was also impressed that the show was personalised and we were able to interact with Acker to perform some magic on our side!!😝 There was never a dull moment throughout and I really liked how creative the tricks were (my eyes were glued to the screen)!!

In the case of the Acker and the MADgicians, nothing could be further from the truth. Although the delivery was virtual, the magic that Acker brought to my family was fantastically real. Never before had my mother been left in sheer awe in the comfort of her own living room, nor my sister astounded with glee after performing a seemingly impossible magic act with her own hands. Sprinkled with a hearty dose of story and humor, Acker propelled the show with exciting and inspiring entertainment from start to finish. The setting was chic, the music was inviting, and the streaming quality was superb. The only genuine complaint I have is that the show had to end.If you're seeking topnotch live entertainment for your event that will leave your guests with memories to last a lifetime, book Acker and the Magicians now. I know I certainly will again for future events, and I assure you that you'll feel the same enthusiasm after experiencing their magic for yourself."", 'reply': {'time': 'February 2021', 'name': 'Response from Acker', 'comment': 'Thank you for such kind words Markos.

I really appreciate it. :-) Just to let you know that my experience is purely designed for adults and not for children at all, unless it is requested for a children event.however for a team event, when children are invited I have to respect their existance and also do some “fun” tricks and “be silly” to please their ages. They won’t be stay on the screen long enough if I just do mind reading or something requires long attention span. When kids cant enjoy, then adults will have trouble to calm them down.I am probably one of the magicians who can play by the ear to quickly adjust or customize my show when I see children are also present on my screen or when the booker of the event requested me to also please the young audience. I have been hosting close to 1200 virtual magic show and more than 90% are for corporate events geared towards adults. I am like a movie director who has the flexibility to make my movie as a PG13, PG or G :-)Hope that explains.'}}, {'time': 'December 2021', 'name': 'Lita', 'comment': 'David is a very funny and engaging performer, and his show was great for our large (200+ people) company event.

I have been working multiple residencies weekly and performing in big corporations for their official events for more than 10 years. Beyond the local crowd, I have done a performance tour in Europe and the US, including being a headline performer at the Close up gallery at The Magic Castle in Hollywood, CA. Early 2020, my very own theatre show, ""Beyond the Magic of Ming Da"" at FRINGE World Perth received a 4-Star review and was the ""Variety Show Weekly Award"" Winner.

Bhai I have remembered the famous song written by the famous Bollywood Movie - ""Koi Mil Gaya"" on seeing Andrew\'s magic!  Immediately, I got the Experience Book at 8 in the morning and sat down to watch it at 8:30.  It was fun watching.  Andrew showed magic one by one ... and kept all the guests together.  To tell the truth, I was afraid that somewhere Andrew might show his famous Knife and Card Magic somewhere ... know that Knife penetrating the screen directly enters his chest and all the work!  Well nothing of the sort happened… and I survived.  Hahaha.  Andrew now you see my magic.  You are a star  That\'s why I give you One Star ... but when you see the review you will see Five Stars!

We will end by teaching a trick that you can learn and perform to amaze and impress your own friends, family, or colleagues!Great for family get together, corporate parties and team-building events! I've had teams from Facebook, Netflix, Spotify, Yelp, Accenture, Deloitte, Kaiser,  Redfin, and more book this for their team happy hour or holiday parties.

Since I was a kid in elementary school, I have been fascinated with the art of astonishment. I used to do card tricks for my friends and teachers, and with hours of practice I eventually moved on to birthday parties, anniversaries, weddings and corporate events. I have performed for thousands of people around the world and I absolutely love making people gasp in amazement, question their reality or be confused for days!I am the vice-president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians in Sacramento and a member of the Society of American Magicians.  I have over 50 5-Star Reviews on Yelp, Google, and Bark.com.

I had invited 8 people to attend, however some of them joined zoom with their partners/roommates. I didn’t realize booking for a private group was “pay per pair of eyeballs” rather than zoom attendee.  I was charged an additional $100 post experience for the extra attendees.  I totally understand the reasoning but if they had quoted this price upfront, I probably would’ve booked a different experience as the Value to Price ratio was off.  Magic tricks were great, the mentalism was not as impressive/engaging.  I think there are probably better group experiences for the price I paid.', 'reply': {'time': 'January 2021', 'name': 'Response from Vikram', 'comment': ""Hi Lid,Thanks for the feedback. I know it can be a little confusing, especially if it's your first AirBnB experience. If you had added all the attendees when booking, it would have given you an estimate accordingly. Just like when you go to a live event and you book a certain number of seats, but show up with more people, you would be expected to purchase tickets for the additional guests. This works the same way. The responsibility for the unexpected guests lies with the booker and not the host. However, I do appreciate you paying for the additional guests and taking care of that afterwards. I also understand the potential confusion with private events so I have made an extra effort to be more clear about AirBnBs policy with my guests and bookings since your event. I'm sorry that the confusion impacted your experience and the rating you gave and I will continue trying to improve the experience for all my guests in the future.""}}, {'time': 'January 2021', 'name': 'Vikram', 'comment': 'Wow!!

That is why for my 32nd birthday I wanted to treat myself and a close group of 15 friends from across Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Texas, Connecticut and Washington D.C. to an experience of  lifetime and that was to join me in celebrating my birthday with MAGIC. I have been fortunate enough to  see Alex\'s shows LIVE in Lima, and they were spectacular because he has been doing magic and learning magic for 20 years, but to see him bring to life a brand new show that lasts  90min on ZOOM was something unlike anything I have ever experienced. Alex kept us all on the edge of our seats and made us laugh and applaud and scream out ""Bravo"" to our screens after every act. There is NO online experience that can equate the craftsmanship, story-telling and care that Alex has utilized to make this show feel like it leaps out of the screen and into your home. I recommend his show 1000% and if you book this show you too will remember what it was like to be in awe of somebody\'s natural talent. This magic show is full of emotions and it will connect you to those you love and by inviting friends along with you on this magic ride you will give them back some of the happiness that this global pandemic has robbed them of for too long. We are living in complex times, and we all deserve a break from the trauma of the daily news.

He then came prepared, knowing their names and having a magic trick especially for my father.  He was great with the audience - ensuring everyone was included and balancing across the full range of ages and interests.  The entire 90 minutes was engaging and delightful, from being amazed by magic to learning about Martin\'s varying exploits, to the hands-on element where we learned to perform magic ourselves.

Specifically, when I asked him what J. was at Trump, he replied that J was a prince.Using Trump as a job without knowing the basics is a disqualification, but completely ignoring students with unknown questions is a shameful act as a teacher. After that, he kept calling only the other three names.He gave a lot of quizzes to the other three.When he called only the three names in sequence, I was distracted, completely lost positive feelings, and sad. He speaks English well but does not treat participants as humans. Terrible.', 'reply': {'time': 'May 2020', 'name': 'Response from Martin', 'comment': 'Hi Miho, I’m truly sorry you had such a negative experience and I would like to add some clarity to your comments.This group consisted of yourself, two boys aged below 10 (who were exceptionally well behaved) and another female guest, so it was far from being a full group. From the start, I called you all out individually to ensure your connections were stable and to establish where you were tuning in from around the world. As you live in Japan and English is your 2nd language, I also discussed  with you slowing my speech to make it easier for you to follow during the session.The first 2 tricks in the session involve all participants and I called you out on numerous occasions throughout this time. You then asked me 1 question - what the ‘Jack’ card was in a deck of cards - to which I explained it is the lowest value court card or could be considered like the ‘prince’ to the King/Queen. To add to this, I also provided you with additional insight on how a deck of cards is constructed to reflect the natural world:Red+black - night+day / 4 suits - 4 seasons / 13 cards per suit - 13 phases of the moon / 52 cards (excluding jokers) - 52 weeks in the year / And if you add up all pips on each of the playing cards, it comes to a total of…you guessed it…365.I am at a bit of a loss as to how you feel this didn’t answer your question at the time? (Unless I completely misunderstood and you were actually asking me the middle name of a foreign president, to which I’m afraid politics isn’t my speciality.)During the section of the experience where I spoke about doing magic for children in hospitals, I made reference to 2 moments that had happened previously involving the other guests. At this point you claimed I was excluding you, however I assured you this wasn’t the case and also continued to make you a central part of the experience when the magic resumed after the talk.What didn’t help was that throughout the session, you kept walking off or playing on your phone, only to then ask me to repeat what I had just said because you missed it. You also kept talking with someone who was sat off camera and when I asked you to introduce them, you claimed nobody was there. (I assume this is due to you only paying for 1 guest space, but wanting others to watch with you.)Finally when we came to the workshop section, I spent an extra 10 minutes talking you through step-by-step how the first trick worked, however by this point you decided you were no longer interested and chose to leave the session. I could not have done more to try and accommodate you during the session and I also sent you further information and video links to the tricks you missed because you decided to leave early.FINAL NOTE (for anyone reading this response)Working in children’s hospitals has allowed me to adapt what I do to fit a variety of needs including autism, aspergers, down syndrome, ADHD, deafness and even blindness. The Secrets of Magic experience is designed to be a safe and positive space for any guest wishing to join from around the world, irrespective of your needs. If you are concerned you ‘won’t be treated like a human’ then please rest assured this isn’t the case and feel free to send a direct message if you have any doubts when deciding to book for yourself or a friend/relative.'}}, {'time': 'May 2020', 'name': 'Eric', 'comment': 'Absolutely fantastic experience!   We booked Martin for our daughter’s 10th birthday which included 6 of her friends.  Martin really made the experience personal and got to know each girl’s name and  made sure that each one was included in some way.  Martin doesn’t just do tricks... he creates a magical experience by connecting with all the audience members in a really personal way.   He was super friendly and patient.  One really cool part of the show was that during the last 30 minutes, Martin taught the girls 3 of the tricks he had done earlier in his performance; all the girls seemed very engaged trying to learn.  Of course there some other really great “tricks” that Martin performed that we are still trying to figure out how he did them.  Highly highly highly recommend this experience!  It was even better than we had hoped.

Martin kicked things off by welcoming everyone personally, and it was wonderful during this lockdown where we are all stuck in our homes to start off by hearing where everyone participating was all over the world, where it's early morning here in San Francisco but evening in London. Martin was a wonderful showman, and showed us some delightful magic tricks during the first half. Then he shared his heartwarming personal story of how he came to be a magician, and how he has used magic to bring joy to people during difficult times. Then, we finished off by learning three separate magic tricks that were easy to master and impressive, that we can all do over video chat for our friends to spread that magic to others during this time. I shared the experience with my parents who are far away in another city, and it was such a treat and a change of pace to be able to laugh and smile with them and to connect during this fun experience after months of being in our separate homes and feeling far apart. Thank you Martin for making us laugh during these tough times and teaching me something so fun to share with people after this!

We were not disappointed! One of my teenagers and I attended, and we so enjoyed watching the magic, learning about Martin’s experiences and personal stories, as discovering how to do some of the tricks ourselves. The number of attendees was just right, making it a personal experience but still having a little bit of an audience to connect with. The images and videos he showed were relevant and entertaining, the tricks he did were really good, and Martin handled the unexpected nuances of performing though Zoom in an authentic and professional manner. He wrapped it up really nicely with a personal connection to our current circumstances, and sent us on our way in an inspired manner. There’s lots of free stuff online right now during this COVID crisis, but the money you pay for this experience is in my opinion well worth it; apart from actually supporting the artist, Martin is a professional Who has created an engaging and enjoyable hour and a half for you to be entertained and learn something new.

Interesting you should say both the coin and card trick were featured in the New York Times not long ago in the private feedback. I must admit being in England I don't read it and nobody else across any of the experience sessions to date has mentioned this. I'm sorry you felt the experience only deserved 4 stars because you already knew 2 of the tricks. When I asked at the time if anyone knew the trick before teaching them, you should've mentioned something, I'm a magician, not a mind reader after all! ;-)""}}, {'time': 'April 2020', 'name': 'John', 'comment': 'Martin is amazing - personable and fun.
