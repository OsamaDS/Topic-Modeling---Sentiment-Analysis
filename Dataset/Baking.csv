Everything else is pretty clear. We also tried to triple one of the recipes (hehe) during the class, which really threw off our timing -- I don't recommend doing that! She sends the recipes afterwards so if you want to make more, maybe hold off until after the class or another time. She is a sweet person who's very on top of her timing.

I've been taking many online classes/webinars during the past few months and cannot say enough about how Najlae's energy, diligence, knowledge and kindness far exceeded that of any others! The food was delicious and wonderfully well-rounded–the chicken tagine, sesame cookies and crepes provided great nourishment for the body, mind and soul. Najlae did a great job of pacing the lesson itself and would check in to ensure everyone had the direction they needed.

We got to make 3 different dishes that all came out delicious. The lamb and date came out amazing. Instead of the traditional tajine, I cooked it in a pressure cooker and it’s the perfect quick and easy week night dinner. The mix of spices and sweetness of the prunes made a great combination. We also made ghriba, which is a delicous, delicate cookie and msemen, which is a perfect flaky crepe. We had a great time talking about life in Morocco and recommendations for when I come to visit.

My wife and I, with our college-age girls, have been cooped up the last 3 months (like everyone else). We were excited to learn about AirBnB experiences. The girls and I bought this one for my wife for Mother's Day. We all like Middle Eastern food and my wife and one of my daughters have been to Morocco. So we were all excited. Najlae made it very easy to participate. The ingredients for the tajine were easy to buy, and we didn't need any special equipment. Najlae was so friendly and really explained all the dishes, how to cook them and how they are typically eaten.  We learned a lot about Moroccan cuisine and even about daily life there. And we made 3 items: a tajine (stew); a crepe (really a flatbread, super-tasty); and a cookie. All three were really good. We came away as friends, and she offered to send us anything we might need from Morocco (special ingredients we can't find in the U.S., for example).  We would for sure do another experience with her. Highly recommended."", 'reply': {}}, {'time': 'June 2020', 'name': 'Tara', 'comment': 'I can not reccomend Najla enough!

He showed some extra dishes that we can make once it's easier to get to stores that carry Turkish ingredients, and I'm looking forward to that. And of course, learning about some of the culture around the food and drink was great! While I don't think any of the dishes were particularly complicated to make,  I had never heard of some of them (especially the Murtağa) and would never have even thought to look them up (or have the ability to understand the recipes in Turkish), and it was very helpful to see everything cooked step by step and be able to ask questions.

I did, and I’d never made a puff pastry before.I did sub a few things- I used bread flour instead of AP, so I think I ended up with more pastels (15) than usual. I also mixed vegan margarine and butter - since Ines did say butter would be better since it was harder, but I’d already bought margarine for the class.Also note to Americans , semi skimmed milk is 1.5-2% milk.

Our group of friends live in three different cities so this was a great way to be together despite the distance and covid restrictions.Before booking: Before I purchased this experience, I had contacted a few hosts that offered online macron classes. Carlos was on top of his emails and even though there was an eight hour difference between us - Carlos in France and myself in Canada - he always answered all my questions in a timely manner.\xa0During the virtual experience: Carlos was on time for our macron cooking class and made sure our group was all on line before he started. He was professional and welcoming.\xa0Our group had varying degrees of baking experience so Carlos took his time to explain the process and would make adjustments to his instructions as we went along. I still don't know how he was able to look at someone's ganache or merengue via Zoom, make small suggestions to their technique or recipe, fix the issue and then find a way to bring us all back to the same step. Even though there were a few technical issues (e.g. participants losing internet connection or participants not using the correct temperature for the macrons), Carlos was very patient and courteous to the other cooks. He took quick breaks to give participants time to socialize or troubleshoot their macrons.\xa0After the experience: Like a great host, Carlos shared the group photos that he took along with the instructions and reminded us to contact him if we run into any issues.I highly recommend Carlos, this experience, and hope to book another one with him in the near future.Mylène"", 'reply': {}}, {'time': 'March 2021', 'name': 'Alexandra', 'comment': 'Excellent class brilliantly led by Carlos. the class was very well organised, had exceptionally high presentation value and made a more challenging topic very accessible.

My goal is for you to find the flour you want for your perfect bread, so my job is to teach you what is available and how to make your own choices, rather than just tell you what to buy.
