I highly recommend this valuable and special session with Stephen if you are looking for inspiration and tangible action items you can apply to improving your life and building a positive mindset. And who doesn’t need a little extra help with that these days? Stephen is an accomplished athlete but in this session he plays the role of coach and offers incredible insights, valuable perspective, and inspiring stories that motivate you to reflect and set some meaningful personal goals. As someone who invests a lot in personal growth and development, I have read a lot about positive psychology, growth mindset and the power of meditation, visualization etc., but the way Stephen delivers the content is human, personal and more effective through his use of storytelling. Remembering theories and concepts can be hard, but Stephen and his stories are unforgettable. He also balances the content with engaging exercises, discussion and humor. He is incredibly charming and a powerful communicator. In my opinion, it’s also an indirect lesson in living in the now. If you focus on being fully present and engaged in what Stephen is saying, it’s easy to see how important and impactful it is.  If you have any hesitation in booking this session, that’s exactly why you should book it.

A champion's mindset is about digging deeper when it matters the most. It's about becoming the best version of yourself when the odds are stacked against you. Some people think a champion's mindset is too hard to grasp. But I’ve had the pleasure to speak to a variety of audiences ranging from students to corporate executives all over the United States, and have made a champion's mindset relatable and attainable.

I will discuss my Olympic experiences, and share powerful strategies so that you can reach your potential. You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from positive thinking. Cultivating a more optimistic perspective works for you no matter your profession or passion. Optimism can take you to unimaginable heights.

Let's connect, and allow me to lift you to a personal best, to your potential, and ultimately to your happiness.","For more than 20 years as a professional athlete, I’ve worked as much on my mental fitness as I have my physical fitness. Doing so allowed me the honor of holding every American record in running distances between 5K and the marathon, and representing the United States on 19 national teams. I'm an Olympic medalist, the American record holder in the marathon, and winner of the London and Chicago marathons. A couple of years ago, I decided to write about the mental evolution of my career in the book, Let Your Mind Run: A Memoir of Thinking My Way To Victory. It became a New York Times Bestseller. Since its release, I continue to run and race, but find great joy in motivational speaking and connecting with others who want to explore the fitness of their greatest asset—their mind.©Getty images",Olympian · Representing USA · Host on Airbnb since 2016,"Meet your Host, Deena",https://z1.muscache.cn/im/pictures/user/4e47e46c-1a97-4d00-a0fe-2990a0a045d2.jpg?im_w=240,"[{'time': 'January 2022', 'name': 'Teal', 'comment': ""I could have listened to Deena's stories and wisdom for hours and hours - it went by too fast!

In this unique storytelling experience, I will discuss my life journey, the road I took to the Olympics, and how I remained hopeful throughout all the obstacles I faced in life. You’ll get to know more about my hometown, the circumstances under which I lost my leg, how I became a refugee, what it was like for me to start a new life in Greece, and most importantly, how my passion for swimming remained a North Star anchoring me to my childhood Olympic dreams. We will think about the power of positivity, how I turn every No to a Yes, and why it is important to always believe in yourself, and challenge the physical and mental boxes others try to put you in, when it comes to your own strength and potential. Join me as we think through the refugee experience, the power of sports in overcoming adversity, and the importance of challenging preconceived notions about refugees and athletes with disabilities.","My name is Ibrahim, a paralympic swimmer & basketball player from Syria, and recipient of the Whang Youn Dai Overcome Prize during the Paralympic Games in Rio. My dreams, my goals, and my ambitions were shattered when I lost my leg in Syria and suddenly became a refugee. However, I kept persevering. I did not have a home or anyone to help me, but I kept going and learned to think beyond physical disability. By doing so, it’s allowed me to achieve many things, both physically and mentally, that have helped define my 20-year journey. Now I live in a new country where, at first, I didn't speak the language, nor did I have my family with me. Despite all of my hardship, I've endured, and I want others to benefit from my experiences. With the strength of will and the desire to succeed, I’ve achieved my dreams.

Here’s a little secret: anything significant involves others, and it’s teamwork that has helped me compete successfully and win gold medals. I am training for the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics, and you will join me on a brief virtual tour around my training facility.We’ll have a brief chat about the power of perspective and how we can use this to guide our actions daily, because there's no need for sight when you have a vision.","I am a totally blind Paralympic medalist and world champion in the long jump. I am a four-time Paralympian, four-time world champion, and current world record holder in the long jump with a leap of 22 feet and 1 inch. My goal is to represent Team USA in my fifth Paralympic Games at the Tokyo 2021 Paralympics. I aim to bring back gold for the United States.I'm also an Athlete Mentor for Classroom Champions.

I’ll show you how this incredible movement practice can help you return to a state of peace and harmony. The best part is that anyone can do it, no matter who you are, how old you are, or your physical ability. And it can be adjusted to suit your needs—in fact it helped me go from using a wheelchair to hiking in mountains. The Calligraphy Health System of Qigong is a modern twist on an ancient practice, combining elements of Tai Chi and Yoga, developed by Master Yang, who comes from a 400-year-old lineage. This Experience is great for boosting the energy of your group. I'm excited to share this with you.","I’m an Australian wheelchair tennis champion. I’ve competed in two Paralympics—London and Rio—and was ranked eighth in the world. At age 13, I began a three-year battle with cancer. The only way to save my life was to remove the right half of my pelvis. I was in a wheelchair for many years, but secretly always wondered if I’d be able to walk long distances again. Through Calligraphy Qigong, not only did I walk again, but I put my wheelchair away and went on to hike one of the hardest treks in the world: the Kokoda Track. In addition to giving me back my mobility, the practices healed the chronic pain I lived with for 15 years. There's nothing I love more than practicing on the beach.For the last 10 years I've been sharing my journey and the lessons I've learned with individuals, schools and businesses.",Paralympian · Representing Australia · Host on Airbnb since 2014,"Meet your Host, Adam",https://z1.muscache.cn/im/pictures/user/de652299-268e-4efb-a408-46427335c3d6.jpg?im_w=240,"[{'time': 'February 2022', 'name': 'Tzlil', 'comment': 'Adam’s explanation of the practice as well as his instruction was wonderful and easy to follow!

To help you navigate this process, I'll share the transformational blueprint from my 100-day journey to becoming both the first African woman and the first black woman to compete in the Olympic skeleton—a sport I had no prior experience in and one in which athletes hurl themselves headfirst on a sled down an icy hill at 80 miles an hour. In this interactive experience designed to invite courage and resilience, I'll teach you the valuable lessons I learned in those 100 days—a time when I had returned to competitive sport after a nearly ten-year retirement. Find a comfy spot in your house and I'll walk you through how I reignited my original dream of competing in track and field at the Summer Olympics. Then, we'll explore different ways of overcoming fears, defying naysayers, and shattering perceptions. Imagine your limitless possibilities with an Olympian as I confidently guide you through this experience and help you push your limits and find your inner strength.*This experience is great for team-building.
