It is fun and you learn very useful skills like basic sewing. I like to use socks with a pattern because the dolls inherently get a very unique look that will brighten any day. The experience itself is soothing and by assigning a theme or words to the doll it can represent your stress and provide a healthy way to relief some stress. Since we are making dolls it could seem a family-friendly experience for those days spent indoors. Keep in mind that young kids find it much harder to stay focused than you, so inevitably it is ADULTS that ends up doing the workshop with me, but that is just as much fun. You can teach them yourself later on. No skill is ever wasted. Sharp needles and scissors are also things you need to keep in mind when you sign your child up. Other things to noteI will use two cameras for this experience so you can pin my 'desktopview' with the live-action on your screen and look on my fingers.If you have your theme ready before the workshop we can dedicate the doll to it. But I will show you how to assign a stressfactor to your doll of you want to add it later.",Since I was a little girl I have always been crafting my own stuffed animals and their outfits.
